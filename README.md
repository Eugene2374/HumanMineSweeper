# HumanMineSweeper
Summary:
This is inspired by the classical game called MineSweeper but it is used as a group physical activity. Two teams are required to decide their boxes and run to the boxes once the game starts. The gamemaster is then required to register the team's standing after the timer ends and will tell the team the number of survivors. This process repeats until everyone survives.
** This game was created before learning Git Hub. Thus there will be only an HTML file with both CSS and Javascript in it to use via phone.
